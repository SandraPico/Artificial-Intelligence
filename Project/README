1. MAIN DESCRIPTION:

This project was created by Anna Hedström, David Vega, Antoine Legat and Sandra Picó Oristrell
for the Artificial Intelligence course (DD2380) in the Machine Learning Master at KTH.

The main topic of the project was Planning. For this reason, we choose the Floortile problem of the International Planning competition. 
We solved the problem using PDDL domain as well as comparing it with an Optimization domain.
Both implementations are attached in the implementation folder.


2. IMPLEMENTATION:

In the implementation folder we have the Optimization implementation and the PDDL implementation.
In each of the scenarios, we tested different scenarios to be able to compare both approaches. The different scenarios are explained
in the report of the project. Results section and conclusions are also attached on it.


3. DOCUMENTATION:

The project proposal and report are attached here, as well as the presentation slides.
