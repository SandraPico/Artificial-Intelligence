The first assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course is based on Hidden Markov Models.

The first exercises are based on learning basic stuff: HMM0,HMM1,HMM2 and HMM3.
Later, we have also an experimental stage : HMM_Experimental, for learning and analyzing the results.
Finally, the last implementation was the Duck Hunt game. This is a really good case to fully-understand the HMM in a real-game application.
